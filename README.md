# To-Do-List
Task: Create a Simple To-Do List Application Requirements: The application should have a visually appealing interface with a header, input field, and a list area to display the to-do items. When the user types a task in the input field and presses the Enter key or clicks a "Add Task" button, the task should be added to the list. Each task in the list should have a checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button to remove it. When a task is marked as completed, it should be visually differentiated from the incomplete tasks. The application should support storing the tasks in the browser's local storage, so that when the user refreshes the page, the tasks are still displayed. Include appropriate CSS styling to make the application visually appealing and responsive. Implement functionality to clear all tasks from the list with a "Clear All" button. Guidelines: Use HTML to structure the layout of the application, including header, input field, list area, checkboxes, buttons, etc. Use CSS to style the elements and make the application visually appealing. Consider using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap if desired. Use JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and storing tasks in local storage. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as empty task input or duplicate tasks.
